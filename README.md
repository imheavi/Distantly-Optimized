Distantly Optimized is a modpack featuring Distant Horizions 2.0 and a beta version of Iris, letting you see _really, really_ far, as well as a few shaderpacks that support Distant Horizons, incredible worldgen powered by Tectonic, and some utility mods.


It is designed to be lightweight, work on any server, and update faster than anyone else.

**Best part is, it works right out of the box! The only settings you need to worry about are in the main menu of Distant Horizon's settings, accessed by the button to the right of the FOV slider, in the options menu.**




# What about framerate?
With the settings and specs listed below, I had a stable 60 FPS.

You actually dont need a powerful PC to run this, plus you can turn down Distant Horizons quality and render distance settings, as well as shaders.

Thanks to X0nk for adding Distant Horizions support to Bliss, one of my favorite shader packs! You can find the version included here, which supports Distant Horizons on his Github page: [https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader](https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader)
